# Welcome to the project

So basically, me and a friend got kinda bored in a German lesson and started wondering about the way we percieve face patterns in text. I can't tell you more because that might skew the test. 

## What do I do?

You will be shown a textual representation of a face for a fraction of a second, so **don't miss it**. Then, all you have to do is tap the button at the bottom of the screeen, depending on whether you thought the face was happy or sad. _You can do the test as many times as you like, if you feel like giving us more data to work with._

## What will happen?

We'll record the response you give with relation to what you were actually given. _Hopefully we'll have a results page?_

## Anything else?

Well, pfft... thanks for doing our little test I guess. If you can **share** this project with other people, that would be much appreciated.
